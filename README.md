# Employee Directory

Simple CRUD application that I made in order to try Thymeleaf. The app just lists employees from database and you are able to add new employee 
to the database, update or delete existing one.

## Getting started

These instructions will get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

A step by step tutorial that tells you how to get a development env running:

First
```
Inside a SimpleRealTimeProject/sql folder you will find a SQL script that you need to run in order to create 
your database.
```
Then
```
Open project in your favourite IDE and run file src/main/java/com.sasaivanovic.springboot.thymeleafdemo/
ThymeleafdemoApplication as Java Application.
```
Finally
```
Open your browser and go to localhost:8080.
```
